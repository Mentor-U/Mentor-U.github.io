  On the top left, there is a flyout button where you go to different sections of the app. You can find a new connection, by selecting "Find Connections" tab, and from there you can filter or select whom you would like to connect with.
  
  Clicking on the connection will redirect you to view the user's profile and from there, you can either chat with the user or set up a meeting.
